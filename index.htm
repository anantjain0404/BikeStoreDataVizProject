          <h2>Problem Statement</h2>
          <p>
              In todayâ€™s data-driven world, businesses rely heavily on accurate and comprehensive data to make informed decisions.
              The Bikestore dataset serves as a rich repository, offering valuable insights into customer orders, product categories, sales trends, and revenue distribution.
              However, despite its potential, the dataset presents several challenges that limit its direct applicability for actionable insights.
          </p>
          <p>The key challenges identified include:</p>
          <ul class="styled-list">
              <li>
                  <strong>Data Duplication:</strong> 
                  Multiple duplicate records in the dataset lead to skewed revenue and sales calculations, compromising the accuracy of business insights.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>Incomplete Data:</strong> 
                  Several critical fields, such as revenue, customer location, and product descriptions, contain missing values, limiting the ability to perform a holistic analysis.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>Unstandardized Product Categories:</strong> 
                  A lack of consistent categorization for products hinders segmentation, making it challenging to analyze performance across different product lines effectively.
              </li>
              <li>
                  <strong>Seasonality Insights:</strong> 
                  Limited visibility into seasonal sales patterns prevents businesses from optimizing inventory and aligning marketing strategies with demand fluctuations.
              </li>
          </ul>
          <p>
              These challenges underscore the need for a structured approach to data cleaning, integration, and analysis. By addressing these issues, stakeholders can uncover actionable insights and implement data-driven strategies to enhance business outcomes.
          </p>
          <p>
              This project adopts a systematic methodology leveraging SQL for robust data cleaning, Excel for visualization, and Tableau for creating interactive dashboards. The primary objective is to transform raw data into a refined, analytical dataset that empowers stakeholders with meaningful insights to improve decision-making across inventory, sales, and marketing functions.
          </p>

<!-- Data Cleaning and SQL Integration Section -->
<section class="section">
  <h2>Data Cleaning and SQL Integration</h2>
  <p>
      To prepare the dataset for meaningful analysis, SQL was utilized to clean and integrate the data from various tables. The following steps were undertaken:
  </p>
  <ul class="styled-list">
      <li><strong>Removing Duplicate Records:</strong> Ensured no redundant data skewed sales and revenue analysis.</li>
      <li><strong>Handling Missing Values:</strong> Used logical estimates or category-specific averages to impute missing fields like revenue and product details.</li>
      <li><strong>Standardizing Product Categories:</strong> Grouped products into predefined categories such as "Mountain Bikes," "Road Bikes," and "Accessories" for consistent segmentation.</li>
      <li><strong>Enhancing Data Consistency:</strong> Ensured uniform date formats and applied consistent naming conventions.</li>
      <li><strong>Integrating Data Using Joins:</strong> Combined data from multiple tables (e.g., customers, products, orders) to build a unified dataset that captures customer, product, and sales performance insights.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
      The SQL query utilizes joins to connect various tables (e.g., `customers`, `orders`, `products`, and `categories`) using foreign key relationships. These joins enabled the aggregation of total units sold, revenue, and identification of top-performing products and sales personnel. The use of the `GROUP BY` clause ensures accurate summarization of data at the desired level of granularity.
  </p>
  <p>
      To ensure the dataset was clean and reliable, the following SQL queries were implemented to handle duplicates, missing values, and null fields:
  </p>
  <div class="code-block">
      <pre>
-- Remove duplicates based on key fields
DELETE FROM orders
WHERE order_id IN (
  SELECT order_id
  FROM (
      SELECT order_id, 
             ROW_NUMBER() OVER (PARTITION BY customer_id, product_id, order_date ORDER BY order_id) AS rnum
      FROM orders
  ) t
  WHERE t.rnum > 1
);

-- Handle null values by replacing them with logical defaults
UPDATE products
SET list_price = COALESCE(list_price, 0), -- Replace null prices with 0
  category_id = COALESCE(category_id, 1) -- Assign missing categories to 'Uncategorized'

-- Fill missing revenue values with calculated averages
UPDATE orders
SET revenue = (SELECT AVG(revenue) 
             FROM orders WHERE revenue IS NOT NULL)
WHERE revenue IS NULL;
      </pre>
  </div>
  <p>
      The above queries ensure that duplicate records are removed, null fields are replaced with meaningful defaults or calculated values, and missing revenue data is imputed using average revenue values.
  </p>
  <p>
      After applying the above queries, the dataset was free from inconsistencies and ready for integration. Below is the SQL query for integrating and summarizing the data:
  </p>
  <div class="code-block">
      <pre>
SELECT 
  ord.order_id,
  CONCAT(cus.first_name, ' ', cus.last_name) AS cust_name,
  cus.city,
  cus.state,
  ord.order_date,
  SUM(ite.quantity) AS total_units,
  SUM(ite.quantity * ite.list_price) AS revenue,
  pro.product_name,
  cat.category_name,
  brd.brand_name,
  sto.store_name,
  CONCAT(sta.first_name, ' ', sta.last_name) AS sales_person
FROM sales.orders ord
JOIN sales.customers cus ON ord.customer_id = cus.customer_id
JOIN sales.order_items ite ON ord.order_id = ite.order_id
JOIN production.products pro ON ite.product_id = pro.product_id
JOIN production.categories cat ON pro.category_id = cat.category_id
JOIN sales.stores sto ON ord.store_id = sto.store_id
JOIN sales.staffs sta ON ord.staff_id = sta.staff_id
JOIN production.brands brd ON pro.brand_id = brd.brand_id
GROUP BY 
  ord.order_id,
  cust_name,
  cus.city,
  cus.state,
  ord.order_date,
  pro.product_name,
  cat.category_name,
  brd.brand_name,
  sto.store_name,
  sales_person;
      </pre>
  </div>
  <p>
      This query integrates data across multiple tables and aggregates key metrics such as total units sold and revenue, enabling comprehensive analysis of sales performance.

  <h2>Insights and Recommendations</h2>
  <p>
      The comprehensive analysis conducted on the Bikestore dataset revealed actionable insights and areas of improvement. These recommendations are designed to help the business maximize revenue, optimize inventory, and improve overall operational efficiency:
  </p>
  <ul class="styled-list">
      <li>
          <strong>Prioritize Mountain Bikes:</strong> With Mountain Bikes contributing significantly to the overall revenue, it is recommended to allocate more resources to this category. This includes launching new models, enhancing marketing campaigns targeted toward outdoor enthusiasts, and maintaining sufficient stock levels to meet demand surges.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Seasonal Promotions:</strong> Data trends indicate revenue spikes in certain months, such as August and October. Leveraging these patterns, the business can implement well-timed promotional campaigns, such as limited-time discounts and holiday bundles, to capitalize on increased consumer interest.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Regional Expansion:</strong> The performance disparity across different states highlights untapped market potential. Specifically, targeted marketing campaigns in underperforming regions like the Midwest, along with strategic partnerships with local retailers, could help improve sales in these areas.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Enhance Brand Collaboration:</strong> Collaborating closely with top-performing brands like Trek to launch exclusive product lines or promotional events can further boost sales. Simultaneously, weaker-performing brands should be evaluated for potential adjustments, such as offering value-focused alternatives.
      </li>
      <li>
          <strong>Optimize Inventory Levels:</strong> Data suggests that certain categories, such as Electric Bikes and Cruisers, have a growing demand. Forecasting inventory requirements based on historical data can prevent overstocking or understocking issues, leading to improved operational efficiency.
      </li>
  </ul>
  <p>
      Implementing these recommendations strategically will not only enhance revenue but also improve the customer experience by aligning offerings with consumer preferences and demand patterns.
